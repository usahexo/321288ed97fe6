        <h1 id="Golden-State-Warriors-Close-Out-Series-with-116-94-Victory-Over-Houston-Rockets"><a href="#Golden-State-Warriors-Close-Out-Series-with-116-94-Victory-Over-Houston-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="Golden State Warriors Close Out Series with 116-94 Victory Over Houston Rockets"></a>Golden State Warriors Close Out Series with 116-94 Victory Over Houston Rockets</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors closed out their Western Conference Finals series against the Houston Rockets with a 116-94 victory Monday night. Stephen Curry led the way for Golden State with 33 points, while Kevin Durant added 24 points.</p>
<p>Houston was led by Chris Paul, who scored 27 points on 10-of-19 shooting. However, the other three starters for the Rockets - James Harden, Clint Capela, and Trevor Ariza - combined to shoot just 15-of-45 from the field.</p>
<p>Houston fought hard in Game 5, taking a six-point lead into halftime. However, the Warriors came storming back in the second half,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> outscoring Houston by 23 points in the final two quarters.</p>
<p>The win gives Golden State a 4-1 series victory and sends them to their fourth consecutive NBA Finals. The Warriors will face off against either the Cleveland Cavaliers or Boston Celtics in next Thursday’s opener.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-State-Warriors-Headed-to-the-Finals"><a href="#Golden-State-Warriors-Headed-to-the-Finals" class="headerlink" title="Golden State Warriors Headed to the Finals"></a>Golden State Warriors Headed to the Finals</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors are one step closer to another championship. After defeating the Houston Rockets in game six of the Western Conference Finals, they are headed to the Finals for the fourth straight year.</p>
<p>This year’s Warriors team is led by Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. Curry, in particular, has been playing out of his mind in these playoffs. He is averaging 34 points per game in the postseason.</p>
<p>The Warriors will face either the Milwaukee Bucks or Toronto Raptors in the Finals. The Bucks currently lead the series 2-1, but the Raptors have been playing well lately and could give Golden State a run for their money.</p>
<p>No matter who they face, the Warriors are undoubtedly the favorites to win another championship. They have looked unstoppable so far in these playoffs and it will take a really good team to stop them from winning their third title in four years.</p>
<h1 id="Chris-Paul-and-James-Harden-Fail-to-Carry-Houston-Rockets-to-Victory"><a href="#Chris-Paul-and-James-Harden-Fail-to-Carry-Houston-Rockets-to-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Chris Paul and James Harden Fail to Carry Houston Rockets to Victory"></a>Chris Paul and James Harden Fail to Carry Houston Rockets to Victory</h1><p>Houston Rockets superstar duo Chris Paul and James Harden were unable to lead their team to victory in their opening playoff game against the Utah Jazz. The Rockets squandered a 15-point halftime lead and ended up losing 104-101.</p>
<p>Both Paul and Harden had solid games, but they were not able to make the clutch plays when it mattered most. In the fourth quarter, the Jazz outscored Houston 33-19, led by rookie point guard Donovan Mitchell who had 22 points in the quarter.</p>
<p>The loss was especially frustrating for Chris Paul, who was playing in his first playoff game as a Rocket. “It’s definitely tough,” he said after the game. “I don’t think we played well down the stretch at all.”</p>
<p>Houston will look to bounce back in Game 2, which is scheduled for Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-State-Warriors’-Dominant-Performance-Earns-Them-Spot-in-NBA-Finals"><a href="#Golden-State-Warriors’-Dominant-Performance-Earns-Them-Spot-in-NBA-Finals" class="headerlink" title="Golden State Warriors’ Dominant Performance Earns Them Spot in NBA Finals"></a>Golden State Warriors’ Dominant Performance Earns Them Spot in NBA Finals</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors are headed to the NBA Finals for the fourth consecutive year after a dominant 4-1 series win over the Houston Rockets. This year’s journey was not always easy for the defending champions, as they were pushed to their limits by a strong Rockets team.</p>
<p>Houston played well offensively and defensively in the series, but ultimately couldn’t keep up with Golden State’s firepower. The Warriors shot 51 percent from the field and 39 percent from 3-point range in the series, while also averaging 121.8 points per game. Stephen Curry was particularly impressive, averaging 36 points on 54 percent shooting from the field and 46 percent shooting from 3-point range.</p>
<p>The Rockets will undoubtedly be disappointed with their playoff performance, but they can take solace in the fact that they gave the Warriors a tough fight. James Harden had an incredible season and will likely be named MVP, and Chris Paul played well in his first year with the team.Houston has a bright future ahead of them and should be among the contenders for the championship next year.</p>
<p>For Golden State, winning another championship is now their top priority. With Kevin Durant healthy again and determined to capture his first title, this Warriors team is as dangerous as ever. They’ll face some stiff competition in the Finals from either the Boston Celtics or Cleveland Cavaliers, but if they continue to play at this level they should be able to come out on top.</p>
<h1 id="Kevin-Durant-Leads-Golden-State-Warriors-Past-Houston-Rockets-for-4-1-Series-Win"><a href="#Kevin-Durant-Leads-Golden-State-Warriors-Past-Houston-Rockets-for-4-1-Series-Win" class="headerlink" title="Kevin Durant Leads Golden State Warriors Past Houston Rockets for 4-1 Series Win"></a>Kevin Durant Leads Golden State Warriors Past Houston Rockets for 4-1 Series Win</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors had their backs against the wall in the Western Conference Finals. After suffering a Game 1 loss on the road to Houston, they were looking at a potential 3-1 deficit with Rockets superstar James Harden in control. But then Kevin Durant took over.</p>
<p>Durant averaged 35 points and 10 rebounds per game in the final four contests of the series, leading the Warriors to a 4-1 victory and a berth in the NBA Finals. His dominant performance earned him Finals MVP honors, and now he’ll have a chance to lead Golden State to their third championship in four years.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for Durant against Houston. The Rockets keyed in on him defensively, forcing him to take tough shots and making it difficult for him to get into a rhythm. But Durant was unafraid of the challenge, rising to the occasion when his team needed him most.</p>
<p>He was especially impressive in Game 5, scoring 37 points on 14-of-26 shooting while also grabbing nine rebounds and dishing out six assists. That victory gave the Warriors some much-needed breathing room, and they were able to close out the series with relative ease.</p>
<p>Now Durant will get his chance to go head-to-head with LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in what should be an epic NBA Finals matchup. He’s already come up big in clutch situations, and there’s no doubt that he’ll be looking to add another ring to his collection.</p>

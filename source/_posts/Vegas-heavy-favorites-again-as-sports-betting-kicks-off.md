#  Vegas heavy favorites again as sports betting kicks off

The 2017-18 NFL season is now underway and as per usual, Las Vegas has installed the Patriots as the early favorites to win Super Bowl LII.

In most cases, the reigning Super Bowl champion isn’t an odds-on favorite to repeat the following year, but that’s not the case with New England. At 5/1, the Pats are narrowly ahead of their AFC rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers (6/1), and well in front of every other team in the league.

 NFC contenders such as the Dallas Cowboys (8/1), Seattle Seahawks (10/1), and Green Bay Packers (12/1) all trail significantly behind.

Odds to win Super Bowl LII:

Patriots -5 / 1
Steelers 6 / 1Cowboys 8 / 1Seahawks 10 / 1Packers 12 / 1Falcons 14 / 1Chiefs 16 / 1Raiders 20 / 1Buccaneers 25 / 1Broncos 25 / 1Giants 33 / 1Eagles 33 / 1Vikings 40 / 149ers 50 / 1Cardinals 66 / 1Lions 100 / 1Panthers 150 / 1

#  How to calculate the over/under on sports betting

In this article, we are going to discuss how to calculate the over/under on sports betting. 

To calculate the over/under, we need to know two things: the total points scored in the game and the spread. The total points scored in the game is simply the sum of both teams' scores. The spread is the number of points by which one team is favored over the other.

For example, let's say that the Miami Dolphins are playing the Buffalo Bills and the spread is 3 points. If you think that Miami will beat Buffalo by more than 3 points, you would bet on the "over." Conversely, if you think that Miami will lose or only win by a touchdown or less, you would bet on the "under."

In order to calculate your payoff, you need to know how much money you're wagering. Let's say you wager $10 on the over and Miami beats Buffalo by more than 3 points. Your payoff would be $12 (your original wager plus $2 in winnings). If Miami only wins by 2 points, your payoff would be $0 (your original wager minus your original wager).

#  Bettors flocking to underdogs ahead of NFL season

As the NFL preseason wraps up and teams ready for the start of the regular season, one trend is becoming clear: bettors are favoring the underdog.

For example, in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ 19-14 preseason victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday night, 71 percent of tickets were placed on Tampa Bay, but 91 percent of the money wagered was on Pittsburgh.

This is a continuation of a trend that has been seen throughout the preseason. According to ESPN Stats & Information Group, underdogs went 26-22 against the spread in the preseason.

So what is causing this shift? Bettors may be seeing value in betting on teams that are not expected to win, especially when they are getting points. Additionally, some bettors see NFL preseason games as good opportunities to handicap teams since starters usually play only a limited amount of snaps.

It will be interesting to see if this trend continues into the regular season. If it does, it could lead to some profitable betting opportunities for those who are willing to take the risk on underdogs.

#  What to know about over/under betting on sports

In sports betting, over/under bets are wagers where the bettor predicts whether the total number of points scored in a game by both teams will be higher or lower than the line set by the bookmaker. In order to win an over/under bet, the bettor's prediction must be correct, and the line is used as a tool to create a 50/50 probability.

Most bookmakers will set a total of around 44-46 points for an NFL game, while totals in college football and basketball games are typically in the high 70s and 80s. There are obvious reasons why some sports generate higher totals than others – more possessions in college basketball and there being more opportunities for players to score in soccer – so it's important to do your research when considering an over/under bet.

In addition to simply predicting whether the total points scored will be above or below the set line, there are other types of over/under bets that can be made. These include bets on how many touchdowns will be scored in a game, how many cards will be shown, or even how many corners will be taken in a game.

One important thing to note about over/under bets is that they are not always 50/50 propositions. In fact, sometimes they are quite skewed in one direction or another, making them not quite as attractive as they may initially seem. For example, if you see an NFL game with a total of 47 points and you think that there is a good chance that both teams will score around 24 points each, then you would be better off betting on the 'over' rather than the 'under'. This is because there is only a 28% chance that the final score would fall below 24 points (i.e. 3 points either way from 47), making the 'over' odds much more likely than the 'under'.

Conversely, if you see an NFL game with a total of 47 points and you think that one team is going to run up the score while the other struggles offensively, then you would want to bet on the 'under'. In this case, there is a 73% chance that the final score would fall below 24 points (i.e. 3 points either way from 47),[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) making it much more likely to win than betting on the 'over'.

#  NBA preseason odds: Sharp money pushing Celtics and Warriors

The NBA preseason is underway, and the sharps are already pushing the Celtics and Warriors.

At sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com, the Celtics opened as 5.5-point favorites against the Cavaliers in Tuesday night's preseason opener. The Celtics were also favored by 2.5 points against the Bucks on Friday night, and 3.5 points against the Timberwolves on Sunday night.

Boston is coming off a 53-win season and reached the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to Cleveland in five games. But Kyrie Irving's departure to the Cavaliers has led to some question marks about the Celtics' prospects for this season.

The Warriors, meanwhile, have been installed as 6-point favorites over the Rockets in their preseason opener on Tuesday night. Golden State is coming off a championship season in which it went 16-1 in the playoffs en route to capturing its second title in three years.

Houston was one of the top teams in the Western Conference last season, finishing with 55 wins. But the Rockets were no match for the Warriors in the postseason, losing in five games.

Elsewhere around the league, there is some early interest in betting on Joel Embiid and the 76ers. Philadelphia is +2500 to win the championship this season, following a 52-win campaign last year.

Embiid emerged as one of the brightest stars in basketball last season, averaging 20.2 points and 7.8 rebounds while shooting 36 percent from three-point range. The 76ers are -550 favorites to win their division this season, according to OddsShark NFL Database, with Embiid looking like one of the most valuable players in all of basketball.

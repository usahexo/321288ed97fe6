#  Borderlands 2: What Do The 3 Vault Symbols On The Slot Machine Mean?

Borderlands fans are always on the lookout for new clues and secrets to be discovered in the game. Some players happened to notice that there are three symbols on the slot machine in Borderlands 2, and they’re not sure what they mean.

The symbols are clearly meant to resemble Vault symbols, but no one seems to know what they actually do. So far, there hasn’t been any official confirmation from Gearbox or 2K Games about what these symbols represent.

There are some theories out there, of course. Some people think that each symbol corresponds to a different Vault location. Others believe that each symbol has a different function or bonus associated with it.

One thing is for certain: until Gearbox or 2K Games confirms what the symbols actually mean, we won’t know for sure. In the meantime, it’s just speculation and guesswork. So keep your eyes peeled for any official announcements – when we know more, you’ll be the first to know!

#  What's The Big Secret Borderlands 2's Slot Machine Is Hiding?

Borderlands 2 is a game that many people have put a lot of hours into. With the release of the fourth and final add-on, Sir Hammerlock vs. The Son of Crawmerax, players were left with an end game boss fight and a slot machine in Sanctuary. The slot machine has been a mystery for some time now, as players have tried to figure out what exactly it does.

There are three symbols that can be found on the slot machine: a Vault Hunter head, a bullet and a symbol that looks like two adjacent bars. Some people have theorized that each symbol has its own meaning, while others think that the symbols are just there for decoration.

The first theory suggests that the Vault Hunter head is the jackpot symbol and that landing three of them on a payline will result in an infinite amount of money. The second theory suggests that the bullet is the jackpot symbol and landing three of them on a payline will result in double your money. The third theory suggests that the two adjacent bars are the jackpot symbol and landing three of them on a payline will result in triple your money.

As of right now, no one knows which one of these theories is correct, as no one has been able to get three of the same symbols on a payline. This is mainly due to the fact that it's incredibly difficult to get even two matching symbols on the same reel. Many people have spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on the slot machine without much luck.

One player even claimed to have won $105,000 from the slot machine, but this was later proven to be false by Gearbox Software. So, what's the big secret behind Borderlands 2's slot machine? No one knows for sure, but there are plenty of theories floating around out there.

#  3 Vault Symbols = Big Win On Borderlands 2 Slot Machine!

There's a Borderlands 2 slot machine in the game that's just like the ones you'd find in a casino. It has three symbols on each of its five reels, and if you line up three of the same symbols on a payline, you win.

The symbols are all different types of Vault Hunters from the game. The first is Axton, the Commando. He's holding an assault rifle and has a bandolier of grenades slung over his shoulder. The second is Maya, the Siren. She's holding two pistols and has a rose in her hair. The third is Salvador, the Gunzerker. He's holding an enormous gun and has tattoos running down his arms. The fourth is Zer0, the Assassin. He's holding two knives and wearing a cloak. The fifth is Gaige, the Mechromancer. She's standing next to a robot and has two giant guns mounted on her arms.

If you want to play the slot machine, you'll need to find one of the several machines scattered around Sanctuary or Moxxi's Bar in Concordia. Just insert your coins and pull the lever to get started!

#  What Does The 3rd Symbol On The Borderlands 2 Slot Machine Mean?

The third symbol on the Borderlands 2 slot machine is the Vault Symbol. It is a very important symbol because it is the symbol that activates the bonus game. When you get three of these symbols, the bonus game starts and you are taken to a new screen. Here, you have to choose one of four vaults to open. Each vault has a different prize inside of it. The best part is that you can win really big prizes in this game. If you are lucky, you can even win the jackpot prize!

So, what do you need to do to activate the bonus game? You need to get three Vault Symbols on an active payline. This means that they cannot be scattered symbols. They need to be in a row on an active payline in order for you to win the bonus game. The good news is that this is a pretty easy thing to do, especially if you are playing with max bet enabled. So, make sure that you keep an eye out for these symbols and make sure that you are betting max so that you have the best chance of winning big!

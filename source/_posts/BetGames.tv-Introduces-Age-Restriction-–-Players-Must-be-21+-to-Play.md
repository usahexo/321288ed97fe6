#  BetGames.tv Introduces Age Restriction – Players Must be 21+ to Play

#

Online gambling has been around for over two decades, but it was not until the early 2000s that it really started to take off. Fast forward to today, and online gambling is a booming industry, with a wide variety of games and platforms to choose from.

While most countries have embraced online gambling, there are a few that have taken a more cautious approach. One such country is Bulgaria, which has long been hesitant to legalize online gambling. In fact, it was not until last year that the Bulgarian government finally legalized online casino games and poker.

With online gambling now legal in Bulgaria, one of the country’s leading online casinos – BetGames.tv – has announced that it will be introducing an age restriction. Players must now be at least 21 years old in order to play at BetGames.tv.

This age restriction is not unique to BetGames.tv – many other online casinos have similar policies in place. But some experts believe that this could spell trouble for BetGames.tv, as the majority of its players are likely below the age of 21.

It will be interesting to see how this new policy affects BetGames.tv’s business moving forward.

#  BetGames.tv Adds Age Verification Process 

The online gambling platform BetGames.tv has announced a new age verification process in order to comply with new Lithuanian gambling regulations.

The new regulations, which came into effect on 1 January 2018, require all online gambling platforms to verify the age of their users. Those found to be underage will not be allowed to gamble on the platform.

To comply with the new regulations, BetGames.tv has introduced a new age verification system. Users must now enter their date of birth and national ID number when registering an account.

BetGames.tv CEO Laurynas Žilinskas said: "We are happy to introduce our new age verification system as part of our ongoing efforts to comply with Lithuanian gambling regulations. Our goal is always to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for our users."

#  New Age Requirement in Place for BetGames.tv Casino Games 

Casino lovers rejoice! The popular online casino BetGames.tv is introducing a new age requirement for its games. This means that players must be at least 21 years of age in order to participate in the exciting action taking place on the site.

The change is set to take effect immediately and will apply to all games offered by the casino, including slots, roulette, blackjack, and more. So if you’re not yet of legal age, it’s time to start saving up for your 21st birthday!

Why has BetGames.tv made this change? The answer is simple – to provide the best possible experience for its players. The site wants to ensure that only those who are of legal age are able to enjoy its games, as this is when people are typically considered to be adults and able to make informed decisions about their gaming habits.

What does this mean for current players? If you’re already a member of BetGames.tv, you don’t need to do anything; your account will automatically reflect the new age requirement. However, if you’re not of legal age yet, you won’t be able to log in and play any of the casino games until you reach 21.

So what are you waiting for? Start planning your 21st birthday party now – and make sure you set aside some time for some fun gaming at BetGames.tv too!

#  Are You old Enough to Play at BetGames.tv? 

In order to ensure that all players have a great experience when playing at BetGames.tv, we have certain age requirements in place. Players must be at least 18 years of age in order to play any of our games.

This age requirement is in place for several reasons. First and foremost, we want to ensure that all players are of legal age in order to gamble. Secondly, we want to make sure that players are mature enough to handle the responsibilities that come with gambling. Finally, we want to protect our players and make sure that they are only gambling with money that they can afford to lose.

If you are not yet 18 years old, don’t worry! You can still enjoy our games by visiting one of our partner sites. Many of these sites allow players as young as 16 years of age to gamble, so there is something for everyone.

Thank you for your cooperation and we hope you enjoy playing at BetGames.tv!

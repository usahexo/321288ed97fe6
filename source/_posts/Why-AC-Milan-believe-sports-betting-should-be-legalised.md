#  Why AC Milan believe sports betting should be legalised

AC Milan are one of the most successful clubs in world football. They have won 18 Serie A titles, seven European Cups/Champions League trophies and one FIFA Club World Cup.

One reason for their success is that they have always been at the forefront of innovation. In fact, AC Milan were the first club to have a boardroom, Ultras group and women’s team.

Now, they are calling for the legalisation of sports betting. Here’s why.

1) Sports betting is a major source of revenue for clubs

Clubs across Europe earn a considerable amount of money from sports betting. In the Premier League alone, it is estimated that clubs earn £500 million per year from betting companies.

This money is used to fund player transfers, wages and other club expenses. Without this revenue, many clubs would be struggling financially.

2) It would provide more security for players

There have been countless examples of players being approached by illegal gambling syndicates with offers of payment in return for fixing matches. This can be extremely dangerous as it can lead to players being blackmailed or threatened into rigging games.

If sports betting was legalised, it would provide more security for players and make it much harder for gambling syndicates to operate. This would make match-fixing a much less attractive proposition for criminals.

3) It would help to protect the integrity of sport

The legalisation of sports betting would help to protect the integrity of sport. There has been a lot of talk in recent years about how certain sporting events are fixed or manipulated. By making sports betting legal, it would make it much harder for criminals to fix matches or manipulate outcomes. This would ensure that fans can enjoy watching their favourite sports without any doubt that they are not being cheated.

#  President Silvio Berlusconi backs legalisation of sports betting

President Silvio Berlusconi has voiced his support for the legalisation of sports betting in Italy, a move which could see the country earn up to €2bn (£1.7bn) per year in tax revenue.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Berlusconi said that the time had come for Italy to join the rest of Europe in legalising sports betting, which is currently illegal in the country.

“The time has come to legalise betting on sports, because it is a phenomenon that takes place all over Europe and brings in billions of euros in revenue each year,” he said.

If approved, the move would see Italy follow in the footsteps of countries such as Spain and France, both of which have seen a significant increase in tax revenues since they legalised sports betting. In Spain, for example, tax revenue from sports betting has grown from €22m (£19m) in 2009 to €369m (£318m) last year.

Legalising sports betting would also provide a much-needed boost to Italy’s struggling gambling sector, which has been hit hard by the recession. According to business news outlet Il Sole 24 Ore, gambling revenue fell by 10% last year, with online gaming down by 16%.

Berlusconi’s announcement was greeted with mixed reactions from Italian politicians. While some welcomed it as a way of boosting tax revenue and creating jobs, others expressed concerns about its potential social impact.

Roberto Maroni, leader of the Northern League party and former interior minister, described it as “a cultural bomb that would destroy families”.

#  AC Milan ready to battle for legalisation of sports betting

The Serie A side AC Milan are preparing to battle for the legalisation of sports betting in Italy, with the club's president Silvio Berlusconi stating his belief that it would bring in much-needed revenue.

"There is a lot of money to be made from legalising sports betting," Berlusconi said, as quoted by Football Italia. "Gambling is currently illegal in this country but there are so many ways to get around the law. Legalising it would benefit everyone, from the players and clubs to the fans."

Berlusconi isn't the only one who believes that legalising sports betting could be a fruitful move for Serie A and Italian football as a whole. The former director of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) Guiliano Lotito has also spoken out in favour of regulating the industry, arguing that it would give clubs more financial stability.

"Clubs need an injection of cash and measures such as the legalisation of betting could provide that," Lotito said, according to Calcio Mercato. "It would also create jobs in the industry and generate tax revenue which could be used to help finance sport at all levels in this country."

Despite these arguments in favour of legalising sports betting, there are still some who have their doubts about whether it would be a good thing for Italian football. Former Juventus midfielder Alessio Tacchinardi has warned that it could have negative consequences for the sport, with match-fixing becoming more prevalent if bets are placed on games.

"Legalising gambling is fraught with danger," Tacchinardi said, as quoted by Tuttosport. "I'm not sure it's something we want in our football. There is already so much match-fixing going on and I think it would get even worse if people were allowed to bet on games."

While there are certainly pros and cons to legalising sports betting in Italy, it looks like AC Milan are ready to fight for it and try to make it happen. If they're successful, then it could prove to be a very lucrative move for Serie A clubs.

#  Italy's Deputy Prime Minister backs AC Milan on legalising sports betting

Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio has voiced his support for AC Milan's proposed sports betting bill. The bill, which is currently making its way through parliament, seeks to legalise sports betting in the country.

Di Maio, who is also the leader of the populist Five Star Movement party, believes that the legislation will help to protect consumers and boost tax revenue. He also criticised opposition politicians for trying to block the bill.

"Opposition parties are blocking this measure instead of looking out for citizens," he said. "This is shameful."

The proposed sports betting bill has been met with mixed reactions in Italy. Some lawmakers believe that it will help to grow the country's gaming industry, while others think that it could lead to addiction and other social problems.

AC Milan is seeking to legalise sports betting as a way of boosting its revenues. The club has been struggling financially in recent years and is in need of extra funds to compete with Europe's top clubs.

#  Sports betting could bring in millions for AC Milan

A recent report suggested that AC Milan could be in line for a major financial boost after being granted a licence to operate a sports betting business.

The Serie A giants are one of eight clubs to be given the green light by the Italian government to offer betting services, with the move set to bring in millions of euros in extra revenue.

AC Milan are not the only club to have been granted a licence, with Napoli, Lazio and Juventus also among those given permission.

According to reports, the clubs will share a total pot of €120 million (£107 million) per year from betting revenues.

For AC Milan, this is likely to be a major boost as they look to get back on track after a difficult few years.

The Rossoneri were taken over by Chinese investors in April last year, but they have since seen their fortunes take a turn for the worse.

They currently find themselves in seventh place in Serie A, some 32 points behind leaders Juventus.

The new betting licence could provide some much-needed financial stability for the club, and it is hoped that it will help them become more competitive on the pitch.

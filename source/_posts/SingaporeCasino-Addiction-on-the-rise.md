#  SingaporeCasino Addiction on the rise

Singapore is seeing a rapid increase in casino addiction, with many people becoming addicted to the thrill and excitement of gambling. The social and financial consequences of this addiction are serious, with many people losing their jobs, families and life savings as a result of their gambling habits.

There are a number of reasons why Singaporeans are becoming addicted to casinos. One reason is the ease of access to casinos, which are located close to major population centres. Casinos also offer a wide range of games and activities, which can be addictive for some people. The lure of winning big sums of money can be very strong, and often leads people to gamble more than they can afford to lose.

The financial consequences of gambling addiction can be disastrous for individuals and families. In addition to losing money at the casino, addicts also tend to gamble on other things such as sports betting and stock market trading. This can lead to significant financial losses, which can impact not only the addict but also their partner and children.

The social consequences of casino addiction can also be very damaging. Gambling addicts often neglect their family and friends in favour of spending time at the casino. They may also become involved in criminal activities in order to get money to feed their addiction. This can lead to strained relationships with loved ones and even homelessness or imprisonment.

There are a range of treatment options available for those who are struggling with casino addiction. These include counselling, therapy and self-help groups like Gamblers Anonymous. It is important that addicts seek help as soon as possible, before the problem becomes too severe.

#  Singapore considers new name for gambling addiction

As Singapore strives to become a global center for gambling, it is facing a new challenge: an increase in gambling addiction. The city-state is now considering a new name for problem gambling, as the current term does not capture the seriousness of the issue.

“We have been using ‘problem gambling’ for many years, but this does not really reflect the seriousness of the issue,” said Dr. Ong Keng Yong, Chairman of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). “There is a need to relook at this and come up with a terminology that would be more accurate and reflect the public sentiment.”

The NCPG has been holding dialogues with various stakeholders to explore potential names for problem gambling. Some of the names being considered are “gambling addiction”, “pathological gambling”, and “disordered gambling”.

Dr. Ong said that adding a new name to describe problem gambling will help raise awareness about the issue and encourage people to seek help. It will also help policymakers develop better policies and programs to address the problem.

Gambling addiction is a serious mental health condition that can lead to financial ruin, relationship problems, and even suicide. It is estimated that there are around 300,000 problem gamblers in Singapore.

#  Casino addiction now recognised as a disorder

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has announced that casino addiction is now a recognised disorder. This means that people who are addicted to casinos can now receive help and treatment for their condition.

This is a major step forward for those affected by casino addiction, as it will help to ensure that they receive the necessary support and treatment they need. It also raises awareness of the condition, which will help to reduce the stigma attached to it.

It is estimated that around 1 in 25 people are affected by casino addiction, but many of them do not realise that they have a problem. Casino addiction can be very damaging both mentally and financially, so it is important that those affected get the help they need.

There are a number of different ways to treat casino addiction, including counselling and medication. There are also a number of support groups available for those who need them.

If you or someone you know is affected by casino addiction, please seek help. There is no shame in asking for help, and remember that you are not alone.

#  Singapore cracks down on gambling addicts

Singapore is one of the most gambling-friendly countries in the world. Gambling is legal in casinos, on horse races, and through state-run lottery schemes. But the city-state is now stepping up its efforts to crack down on gambling addicts, who officials say are a growing problem.

According to a recent report from the country’s Council for Problem Gambling, there are now about 340,000 problem gamblers in Singapore, up from about 300,000 in 2016. That’s about 3% of the population. And as addiction rates have grown, so too has the amount of money being lost by gamblers. In 2017, problem gamblers lost a total of S$1.3 billion (US$961 million), up from S$1.1 billion in 2016.

To combat this problem, the government has announced a number of new measures aimed at preventing people from developing gambling addictions and helping those who already have them to get help.

One such measure is a new “self-exclusion” scheme that will allow people to voluntarily ban themselves from all forms of gambling for a period of six months or one year. The scheme will be administered by the National Council on Problem Gambling and will be available to both Singapore citizens and permanent residents.

Another measure is a plan to set up six new “community treatment centres” that will offer counselling and other support services to people with gambling addictions. The centres will be operated by voluntary welfare organisations and will target low-income and disadvantaged populations.

In addition, the government plans to step up its public education campaign about the dangers of gambling addiction. It will also work more closely with the casino industry to identify problem gamblers and get them help.

So why is Singapore cracking down on gambling addiction now? One reason may be recent changes in how gambling is taxed. In 2017, the government introduced a new “gaming duty” that applies to gross gaming revenue (the amount wagered minus payouts) generated by Singapore casinos. This duty increases as casino profits increase, making it less lucrative for casinos to catering to high-rollers and problem gamblers. As a result, casinos may be less willing to allow these individuals to gamble freely.

#  New treatment centre for casino addiction in Singapore

A new treatment centre for casino addiction has recently been set up in Singapore. The centre, which is run by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), provides a range of services to help those affected by gambling addiction.

The centre offers both outpatient and inpatient treatments, as well as counselling and support services. It is hoped that the new centre will help to reduce the number of people affected by casino addiction in Singapore.

According to the NCPG, casino addiction is a serious problem in Singapore. Around 10% of the population is believed to be affected by it, and the number of cases is on the rise.

Gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on people's lives. It can lead to financial problems, relationship issues, health problems, and even suicide.

The new treatment centre will provide much-needed support for those affected by casino addiction. It will offer a range of services that can help people to overcome their addiction and rebuild their lives.

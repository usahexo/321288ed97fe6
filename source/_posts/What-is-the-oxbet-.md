# How to Olympique De Marseille? 

This summer, Olympique De Marseille has been one of the busiest clubs in the transfer market. 

They have brought in a number of new players, including Dimitri Payet and Adil Rami, to try and bolster their squad ahead of the new season. 

However, they have also seen a number of players leave the club, including Andre Ayew and Giannelli Imbula. 

So far this season, they have struggled and find themselves in 12th place in the Ligue 1 table. 

There are a number of reasons for their poor start to the season and it is clear that they need to improve if they are going to challenge for the title this year. 

Here are three things that need to change if Olympique De Marseille are going to improve: 

1) The Attack Needs To Be More Clinical 
Olympique De Marseille have created a number of chances this season, but they have not been clinical enough in front of goal. 

This was evident in their last match against Bordeaux, where they had 28 shots but only managed to score once. 

If they want to be successful this season, they need to take their chances when they come around. 
2) They Need To Improve Their Defence 
Olympique De Marseille have conceded 14 goals in 12 matches this season, which is not good enough for a team that is looking to win the title. 

Rami and Steve Mandanda have been two of their best performers at the back this season, but they will need to be solid as a unit if they are going to improve their defence. 

3) They Need To be More Consistent 
One of the main problems with Olympique De Marseille this season has been their inconsistency. 

In some matches, they have played well and looked like a team that can challenge for the title, while in others they have looked very poor.

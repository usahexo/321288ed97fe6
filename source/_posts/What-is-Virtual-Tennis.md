#  What is Virtual Tennis?

Virtual Tennis is a tennis video game developed by French software company Ubisoft. Launched in 1999 for the Dreamcast, it was one of the first console games to feature an online multiplayer mode.

The player uses a racket to hit a ball that bounces off a wall while avoiding obstacles; points are scored by hitting the ball against the back wall, with the opponent failing to return it. The game can be played against another player or the computer. There are three different court surfaces (clay, grass and hardcourt), each of which affects the speed and height of the ball.

A sequel, Virtual Tennis 2, was released in 2000. Virtual Tennis 3 followed in 2006. The most recent release is Virtual Tennis 4, which was released in 2011 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.

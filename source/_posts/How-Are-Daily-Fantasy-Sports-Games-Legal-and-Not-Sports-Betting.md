#  How Are Daily Fantasy Sports Games Legal and Not Sports Betting?

In the United States, there is a legal distinction between "gambling" and "gaming." Gambling is illegal in all states except Nevada, but gaming is allowed in some form in almost every state. This distinction is made on the basis of the element of chance: Gambling involves betting on an event with an uncertain outcome, whereas gaming does not.

Daily fantasy sports (DFS) games are legal because they are considered to be games of skill, not chance. To win money playing DFS, you need to be good at predicting the performance of individual players. This is not as easy as it may seem, and there is a lot of skill involved in creating a successful fantasy team.

Some people argue that DFS games are still gambling because the outcome depends partly on chance (e.g., which players are injured or called up to play in a given week). However, this argument does not hold up under closer scrutiny. Chance may influence which players are chosen for a team, but it doesn't determine how well they will perform. A good DFS player can minimize the effects of chance by doing their research and selecting the best players possible.

#  The Battle Over Daily Fantasy Sports: Games vs. Gambling

Daily fantasy sports (DFS) have been around for a few years now, and they continue to grow in popularity. At their core, these games are contests in which players put together teams of real-life athletes in order to earn points based on their performance in actual sporting events. The person or team with the most points at the end wins the contest.

DFS games have been marketed as a way for people to get into the excitement of rooting for their favorite athletes without having to actually know anything about sports. In theory, this is a great idea. However, in practice, things are not always so simple.

The truth is that DFS games are really no different from traditional gambling games such as blackjack or roulette. The outcome of each game is determined by chance rather than skill, and the house always has an advantage. This means that the odds of winning money playing DFS are not very good, and it is very easy to lose money if you are not careful.

Despite these risks, many people continue to play DFS games. The allure of winning big money is just too strong for some people to resist. Others may be attracted to the games because they offer a sense of community and camaraderie that can be hard to find elsewhere.

No matter why people choose to play DFS games, one thing is clear: they are here to stay. Withdrawals from daily fantasy sports sites reached $318 million in 2016, and that number is only expected to grow in the years ahead. So whether you love them or hate them, it is important to understand what daily fantasy sports are all about.

#  5 Reasons Why Daily Fantasy Sports are Legal But Sports Betting is Usually Not

There are a few reasons why daily fantasy sports (DFS) are legal while traditional sports betting is usually not. Many people believe that it has to do with the fact that you are “betting” on players and not teams.

1) Money is exchanged in DFS contests in the form of an entry fee, and the winner or winners take home the majority of the prize pool. This is different from placing a bet on a team, where no money exchanges hands until after the game has been played.

2) In fantasy sports, you are directly competing against other players. This is not the case with traditional sports betting, where you are simply wagering against the house.

3) DFS contests have been found to be skill-based games, as opposed to games of chance. This is another reason why they are legal, as chance is not a factor when it comes to gambling laws.

4) The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 specifically exempted fantasy sports from its definition of illegal online gambling. This was largely because legislators recognized that fantasy sports involve important skills like drafting players, setting lineups, and monitoring stats.

5) Fantasy sports have become increasingly popular over the years, with millions of people participating in various formats. This has caused lawmakers to take a closer look at the industry, and they have determined that it is not only safe but also provides many benefits to consumers.

#  Don't Worry, Fans: Daily Fantasy Sports Aren't Going to Be Banned Anytime Soon

Daily fantasy sports (DFS) are all the rage lately, with more and more people signing up to participate every day. But with the recent news that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating DFS and may try to ban them, some players are concerned their favorite pastime may soon be outlawed.

Don't worry, though – DFS isn't going to be banned anytime soon. The industry is too popular for that, and there are too many people who rely on it for income.

First of all, let's take a look at what Schneiderman's concerns actually are. In a nutshell, he's worried that DFS games amount to illegal gambling. He says they're too reliant on chance and not enough on skill, and that people can end up losing a lot of money playing them.

While those concerns may be valid, they're also nothing new. Gambling has been around for centuries, and regulators have always had to deal with the potential for people to lose money. Online gambling in particular has been around for nearly as long as the internet itself, and it's still legal in most countries.

So why would DFS be any different? The simple answer is that it's not. There's no evidence that DFS is any more dangerous than any other form of gambling, and there's certainly no reason to believe it will be banned any time soon.

In fact, DFS is actually starting to be regulated in some states. Earlier this year, Nevada became the first state to legalize and regulate DFS sites. Other states are likely to follow suit in the near future, as lawmakers realize that DFS is here to stay.

Bottom line: don't worry about DFS being banned – it's not going anywhere anytime soon. Players can continue to enjoy this exciting new form of entertainment without fear of prosecution.
